# her_shield

HerShield is a mobile application designed to increase women's safety on the streets or in public places.

## Description

Nowadays, women's safety is highly threatened. Creating an app that can help women stay safe would not only be a fantastic Flutter app idea but also a life-changing one. You can add features that allow women to share their location in real-time with trusted contacts, organize safety check-ins, alert emergency services with a panic button, and much more.

## Features

- **Trip Check-up**: Monitor a trip (e.g., a 2 km journey) with checkpoints every 500 meters. If no issues are detected, the checkpoint is marked as verified.

- **Adding Safe Contacts**: Add trusted contacts to receive SMS alerts or notifications in case of problems.

- **Facial Recognition**: Create an account based on facial recognition to ensure that the user is a woman before accessing the app.

- **Emergency Signal**: Send a distress signal based on location, which will be transmitted to all users of the app within a certain radius.

- **"Close Contact" Account**: Ability to create an account for close contacts who can access the location of the user or users who have accepted the close contact.

## Storage

- **Firebase**: For managing users and real-time data. (FireAuth and FireStore)
